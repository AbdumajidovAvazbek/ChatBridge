### Logo Concept:

*Visual Description*: 
A chat bubble bridging two outlines of the Telegram logo. This signifies the connection or "bridge" between the traditional Telegram chat and the enhanced ChatBridge interface.

*Colors*:
- Telegram's official blue for the logo outlines.
- A shade of gray or white for the chat bubble.
- Optionally, a subtle gradient to add depth.

This logo can be placed at the top of the README as depicted, and wherever else needed in the application or marketing materials.

Remember to replace placeholders with actual links, paths, or information. For creating the logo, you can utilize graphic design platforms like Canva, Adobe Illustrator, or work with a professional graphic designer to bring the concept to life.
